# v0.0
Origin program: github/zhbli/faster-rcnn/Sample_rois_handly/v1.0
Train net using manually sampled rois.

Usage: Run `trainval_net.py`

Change list:
- [Modify_function] _sample_rois

Result: 
(fg_num=192) Mean AP = 0.6084, 70000 iters; mAP = 0.63, 120000 iters. The result is not good.
If set fg_num = 64, We can get mAP = 0.6974. It means the code I have changed has no bug.

# v1.0
Sample RoIs by attention scores.
The ground_truth_attention_file is generated by `github/zhbli/fast-rcnn/v4.3`.

Usage: Run `trainval_net.py`

Change list:
- [Modify_file] trainval_net.py
- [Modify_function] _sample_rois
- [Add_function] filter_fg_rois_by_attention
- [Add_function] get_IoU

# v1.1
Visualize sampled RoIs.

Usage: Run `trainval_net.py`

Change list:
- [Add_function] visualize_rois
- [Modify_function] _proposal_target_layer

Result: (bad)
AP for aeroplane = 0.6911
AP for bicycle = 0.7587
AP for bird = 0.6013

AP for bottle = 0.3492

AP for sofa = 0.6296
AP for train = 0.7503
AP for tvmonitor = 0.5998
Mean AP = 0.6381

Bug:
While the IoU is accurate, the distribution of RoIs is not uniform around ground_truth.
